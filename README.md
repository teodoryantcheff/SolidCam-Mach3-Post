# SolidCam-Mach3-Post
## A SolidCam postprocessor for Mach3, supporting 4x and 5x operations

Inspired by bogan - http://www.cnczone.com/forums/solidcam/255556-cnc.html

Setup: standard 3 axis mill. A axis rotary, along X.

##Current status :
 - 3 axis - considered working
 - 4 axis - works for both repositioning moves and 4x toolpaths
 - 5 axis - works, issue being that Z and probably A are inverted
 
##Never even tried :
 - Drill cycles of any kind
 - Canned cycles of any kind
 - Tapping
 - Tool offsets and compensation 
 - Not even air cutting time on a real machine of any kind
