A SolidCam postprocessor for Mach3, supporting 4x and 5x operations

Setup
 standard 3 axis mill. A axis rotary, along X.

Current status :
 - 3 axis - considered working
 - 4 axis - works for both repositioning moves and 4x toolpaths
 - 5 axis - works, issues being that Z and probably A are inverted
